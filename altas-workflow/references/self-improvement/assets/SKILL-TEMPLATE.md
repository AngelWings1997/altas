## Naming Conventions

- **Skill name**: lowercase, hyphens for spaces
  - Good: `docker-m1-fixes`, `api-timeout-patterns`
  - Bad: `Docker_M1_Fixes`, `APITimeoutPatterns`

- **Description**: Start with action verb, mention trigger
  - Good: "Handles Docker build failures on Apple Silicon. Use when builds fail with platform mismatch."
  - Bad: "Docker stuff"

- **Files**:
  - `SKILL.md` - Required, main documentation
  - `scripts/` - Optional, executable code
  - `references/` - Optional, detailed docs
  - `assets/` - Optional, templates

## Extraction Checklist

Before creating a skill from a learning:

- [ ] Learning is verified (status: resolved)
- [ ] Solution is broadly applicable (not one-off)
- [ ] Content is complete (has all needed context)
- [ ] Name follows conventions
- [ ] Description is concise but informative
- [ ] Quick Reference table is actionable
- [ ] Code examples are tested
- [ ] Source learning ID is recorded

After creating:

- [ ] Update original learning with `promoted_to_skill` status
- [ ] Add `Skill-Path: references/superpowers/skill-name` to learning metadata
- [ ] Test skill by reading it in a fresh session
- [ ] Add to reference-index.md if broadly applicable

## ALTAS Specific Guidelines

When creating skills for ALTAS Workflow:

1. **Area Alignment**: Ensure the skill's Area tag matches ALTAS areas (workflow, routing, spec, execute, review, archive, testing, prd, config)

2. **Integration Points**: Consider where in ALTAS workflow this skill should be referenced:
   - SKILL.md (main rules)
   - references/entry/aliases.md (trigger words)
   - references/testing/ (test strategies)
   - references/special-modes/ (special modes)
   - references/superpowers/ (superpowers)

3. **Chinese Localization**: For ALTAS, prefer Chinese descriptions and examples while keeping technical terms in English

4. **Pattern-Key**: If this skill addresses a recurring pattern, assign a stable Pattern-Key for Simplify & Harden Feed integration

5. **Promotion Path**: Document which rule files this skill could be promoted to if widely adopted
